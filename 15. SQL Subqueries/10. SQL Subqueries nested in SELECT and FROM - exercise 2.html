<p>Fill <i>emp_manager</i> with data about employees, the number of the department they are working in, and their managers.</p>

<p>Your query skeleton must be:

  </p>

<p><i>Insert INTO emp_manager SELECT</i>

  </p>

<p><i>U.*</i>

  </p>

<p><i>FROM</i>

  </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(A)</i>

  </p>

<p><i>UNION (B) UNION (C) UNION (D) AS U;</i>

  </p>

<p>A and B should be the same subsets used in the last lecture <i>(SQL Subqueries Nested in SELECT and FROM)</i>. In other words, assign employee number 110022 as a manager to all employees from 10001 to 10020 (this must be subset A), and employee number 110039 as a manager to all employees from 10021 to 10040 (this must be subset B).

  </p>

<p>Use the structure of subset A to create subset C, where you must assign employee number 110039 as a manager to employee 110022.

  </p>

<p>Following the same logic, create subset D. Here you must do the opposite - assign employee 110022 as a manager to employee 110039.

  </p>

<p>Your output must contain 42 rows.

  </p>

<p>Good luck!
