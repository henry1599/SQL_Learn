00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:07,820
In this lesson we will see all sub queries can be incorporated within as well queries as their name

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,490
suggests some queries are queries embedded in a query.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:21,310
They are also called Inner queries or nested queries and they are part of another query called an outer

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:30,760
query alternative names for these rescue features our inner select an outer select respectively sub

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,070
queries can be applied in many ways.

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:40,590
Nevertheless the main idea is the same most often a sub query is employed in the WHERE clause of a select

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,200
statement.

8
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,750
Let's see an example as we run this query.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,280
We retrieved 24 records which means 24 people currently work in the enterprise as managers.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,720
If our database is in perfect condition the same 24 people must be registered in the Employees table

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:07,080
where we can find different information about them.

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,550
So I assume you are interested in obtaining the names of all employees working within the enterprise

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,990
as managers.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:21,380
Keep in mind that names can be found only in the Employees table not in the department manager table.

15
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,880
There are a few ways you could obtain the design the desired result.

16
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,170
We will try the one involving the use of sub queries as it will allow us to extract the required information

17
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,470
from the first table.

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,870
So long as the same employees have been registered in the department manager table

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,730
let's check the relevant syntax.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,250
We select the first and last name from the Employees table for the same employee numbers that can be

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,070
found in the department manager table.

22
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,610
The last condition has been set through the where clause in the in operator which you already know how

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,440
to use.

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,870
It will list all employee numbers recorded in the department manager table.

25
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,680
After we execute this query we will be able to verify the data about all 24 managers has been stored

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,970
in the Employees table as well great.

27
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,290
Let's analyze this example.

28
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,420
First the outer query is the entire code starting from select first name last name and so on until the

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,460
in operator

30
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,620
the sub query or the inner query that is nested within the outer query.

31
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,380
Is this little bit here.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,630
Remember a sub query should always be placed within parentheses.

33
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,980
In this case we should make no exception to this rule as well.

34
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,910
From a processing point of view the fuel engine starts by running the inner query that it uses its return

35
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,860
output which is intermediate to execute the outer query.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,310
In general a sub query may return a single value a scalar a single row a single column or an entire

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,700
table.

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,060
In our case it delivers the entire employee number column from the department manager table.

39
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,590
Actually to prove this is the case we could run the sub query as a standalone query

40
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,760
after we execute this bit of code.

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,560
We obtain the employee number column the way we should have

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,590
fantastic although we will not dive into tasks that are too complex.

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,580
Please remember you can have a lot more than one sub query in your outer query.

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,810
It is possible to nest in her queries within other inner queries thus allowing your analysis to achieve

45
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,380
significant depth.

46
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,280
In that case the Cuil engine would execute the innermost query first and then each subsequent query

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,460
until it runs the outermost query.

48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:27,030
Last Stay tuned for the next video in which we will see another example of a query containing a sub

49
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,300
query that will do for now.

50
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,450
Thank you for watching.
