1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,490
Aweary.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,360
Right.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:10,020
So some queries can be executed within a select statement or with a FROM clause as well not just with

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,560
the WHERE clause.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,710
This means they can be placed pretty much anywhere in a query.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,260
So long as it makes sense to do so.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,710
In my opinion you have advanced with as well a lot at this point.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,120
Congratulations for that.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,430
That's why in this lecture we're not going to keep things simple.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,800
We are going to complete a challenging task together based on that.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,280
After the video you will face an exercise that is much harder.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,980
However it is of paramount importance not just because you will solidify the knowledge gained in this

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,020
video and as you well in general but we will use its output in our next lecture which is about self

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,210
joins OK.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:04,550
Having said that let's begin here's the task assigned employee number 1 1 0 0 0 22.

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:17,420
As a manager to all employees from 1 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 20 or from 1 to 24 brief and Employee Number 1

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,440
1 0 0 39.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:30,120
As a manager to all employees from 21 to 40 good the result is a mixture of two subsets of results.

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,380
The first one is subset A.

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,530
It will be the Group of the first 20 employees associated with manager 1 1 0 0 22.

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,030
The second one will call subset B.

22
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:51,540
It will contain data about the employees assigned to manager 1 1 0 0 39 the unification between the

23
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,750
two subsets will be made through a union and the tables from which we will be extracting data will be

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,050
employees and department manager.

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,050
All right.

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,690
So let's start from the innermost query of the first block.

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,260
This is the code that would allow us to select the employee with number 1 1 0 0 22 from the department

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,650
manager table.

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:27,660
It is easy to understand now we will add this inner query to the select statement of an outer query.

30
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:36,960
The outcome of this bigger block must be a table with an employee ID department code and a manager ID.

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,220
In addition all employee IDs will be smaller than 1 0 0 20.

32
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,010
Let's type the code we need.

33
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,380
We will select the employee number as Employee ID

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,900
and the minimum value of a department number as department code.

35
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,560
We take the minimum value because more than one department could be associated with an employee and

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:15,640
by using men we will ensure we place only one value corresponding to an employee number.

37
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,860
At this point we'll have to use the sub query of the select statement.

38
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:32,020
As usual we will place the content of the sub query within parentheses and add an alias.

39
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:44,060
By doing this we end the select part of the outer query lovely OK this means we must proceed with from.

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,040
And the other clauses will need to use

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,740
you are quite familiar with the structure needed to complete the remaining part of the code so we won't

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,330
analyze it in detail.

43
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,020
Basically what we are doing here is joining the employees in the department manager tables where no

44
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:17,000
employee number is greater than 1 0 0 20.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,760
All right let's execute the query.

46
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,110
Great.

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,620
We obtained the 20 row table we wanted.

48
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,510
Perfect.

49
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,900
We will proceed by inserting this entire code within the from statement of an even outer query.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,140
It will be the last level of queering.

51
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,620
So we will not go further out if it makes sense to say so in as well terms.

52
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,710
This will be a small step.

53
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,660
All we have to do is surround the code with parentheses rename it.

54
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,230
Subset A and attach it after select everything from A

55
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,880
and from.

56
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,150
This is how you can use a sub query or an inner query in the From statement of an outer query.

57
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,900
Let's see if it works properly

58
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,920
yes it does.

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,730
However the output was in no way different from the one we obtained earlier.

60
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,160
That's OK because at this stage we don't need to retrieve additional data.

61
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,170
We needed to give a name to this set which will be a subset in the bigger query we will create in a

62
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,020
minute.

63
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,770
Hence all we did here is create an output called a awesome.

64
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,540
Finally we must combine this subset with the other one.

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,290
We will call be.

66
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,070
We all use the same code and then type union.

67
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,610
What follows is an identically structured piece of code that will bring subset before us.

68
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,280
That's all we will need to accomplish our task.

69
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,550
We will not create b separately.

70
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,390
Let's first copy and paste what we have for a

71
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,460
now.

72
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,800
We will edit only the lines that will bring the desired outcome.

73
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,600
We said we needed manager 1 1 0 0 39.

74
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,750
So we can change the conditional value in the inner most select.

75
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,080
Furthermore we would like to have 20 people who are different from the ones provided by subset A.

76
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:41,070
So we will change the where condition to greater than 1 0 0 20 finally because we said these employees

77
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:47,570
must be 20 we can add a limit 20 at the end.

78
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,730
And when we rename this entire block to be and add a semi-colon we will be done.

79
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,620
Is this true.

80
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,920
Absolutely.

81
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,620
A task that looks so simple required almost 50 lines of code.

82
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,750
Amazing when you are writing queries as long as this one.

83
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,930
Please pay particular attention to the indentation.

84
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,300
If all rows started from the same horizontal position the code would have been hard to read.

85
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,960
That's why it is essential to begin each sub query level with an indent to the right

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,020
well then I hope you will agree that writing a 50 row query is not that scary.

87
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,690
I'm confident that coding step by step you can do that too.

88
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,840
Please feel free to rewind this video if necessary and to change the code to obtain similar or different

89
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,170
output when you feel you are well acquainted with the topic of sub queries.

90
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,310
Move on to the exercise attached.

91
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,760
It will be challenging and will deliver the table we need for our next video.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,080
Thank you for watching.
