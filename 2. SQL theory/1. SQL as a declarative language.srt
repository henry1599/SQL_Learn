Now that you know what a relational database is and have an idea about how it works, it is much easier
1

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,490
to understand how SQL fits in the whole picture. SQL is the programming language you need
2

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,520
to execute commands that let you create and manipulate a relational database.
3

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,540
We will not delve into strict and detailed technical definitions to explain how it works.
4

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,810
What you need to know is there are a few types of programming out there - procedural (imperative), object-
5

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,420
oriented, declarative, and functional. Although with some procedural elements, SQL is mainly regarded
6

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,610
as a declarative programming language, it is non procedural.
7

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,190
This means while coding you will not be interested in how you want the job done.
8

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,190
The focus is on what results you want to obtain.
9

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,560
An abstract example would best clarify what we mean here.
10

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,810
When using a procedural language, such as C or Java, you must explicitly divide the solution of a certain
11

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,990
problem into several steps.
12

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,540
For instance: 1. Please open the door. 2. Go outside 3.
13

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,390
Take the bucket.
14

15
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,510
I forgot there. 4. Bring it back to me.
15

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,760
In a declarative language, this would sound like:
16

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,280
1. Fetch the bucket, please.
17

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,830
And you wouldn't have to go through the process step by step.
18

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,460
The algorithms are built-in, and there is an optimizer, which will separate your task into smaller steps
19

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,930
and do the magic to bring the desired output.
20

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,390
Why is this important? When using SQL,
21

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,370
you should concentrate on what you want to retrieve from your databases.
22

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,110
Unless you are an advanced user, don't bother with the algorithms explaining how your data can be obtained.
23

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,180
Acknowledging SQL is principally a declarative language,
24

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,570
now we can go through the main components of its syntax.
25

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,610
It comprises a Data Definition Language (known as DDL), a data manipulation language (abbreviated DML), a data
26

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,280
control language (DCL), and a transaction control language (TCL).
27

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,230
These will be the topics of our next few videos.

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,530
