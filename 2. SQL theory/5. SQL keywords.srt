Let's stop for a quick side note. ADD is a keyword,
1

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,250
and so are CREATE and ALTER. For instance, keywords in SQL cannot be variable names.
2

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,200
Think of them as words that constitute the language. The software you are using will understand which
3

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
commands and operations you wish to carry out,
4

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,900
namely through these words. To avoid any confusion for the software, objects or databases cannot have
5

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,010
names that coincide with SQL keywords. To exemplify,
6

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,760
think of all one-word statements like CREATE an ALTER.
7

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,690
They are keywords. So, you can't call your table "alter",
8

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,180
since this is a name that can trigger a certain process -
the modification of the content of a designated
9

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,110
table.
10

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,860
So, back to our example, ADD is the keyword that will add a column, called "Date of Purchase", in the "Sales"
11

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,750
table.
12

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,780
It is one of the keywords frequently used with the ALTER statement.
13

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,770
Finally, don't get confused if you hear the term reserved words.
14

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,130
It is a synonym for keywords, which indicates precisely what we explained;
15

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,650
these words cannot be used when naming objects.
16

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,340
Ok. So that's about it for keywords.
17

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,420
Thank you for watching!
