<p>In the next lecture, we will be using the <code><strong>ROLLBACK;</strong></code> command.</p><p>There are multiple ways to implement this command in Workbench. One of them is related to toggling off the <em>Autocommit</em> <em>mode</em> button. If for any reason, the third of the three selected icons in the picture below has been pressed, this mode will be turned on, and each statement will be committed immediately. However, thatâ€™s not what we want to happen here.</p><p>Therefore, to avoid some unnecessary errors during the lecture, please check if it has been left intact and if you can see the three icons within the red rectangle in color, just as shown in the picture below. Thank you.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-09-10_11-53-51-b93f1e4374cf380f6e1fc519d1564d08.png"></figure><p>(Alternatively, when the button has been pressed, the tick and the X button will probably appear grey.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-09-10_11-54-01-7fbc0143d52cbbe5175fb4345bf86c8e.PNG"></figure><p>If this is the case, please toggle off the <em>autocommit </em>button by pressing the third of the icons to see the tick and the X button in blue again.)</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-09-10_11-54-15-153a4e97c40fd75c0418c61c0de05384.png"></figure>
