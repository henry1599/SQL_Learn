1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:09,970
All right here we go in the previous section we inserted an employee under the number of 9 9 9 9 0 1.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,320
Remember in here we will update this record the update statement would allow us to do that.

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,950
It is used to update the values of existing records in a table.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,160
The syntax to adhere to is update table name.

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,520
The keyword set column names and the respective values assigned to them.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:41,930
And finally where it is certain condition or set of conditions that must be satisfied by using this

7
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,270
code structure as well will change the record or records satisfying the WHERE condition.

8
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,530
Updating the old values of the columns listed with the new ones ok.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,100
We can see that employee number 9 9 9 9 0 1 is John Smith.

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,470
So we can create a query with the following update statement

11
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,010
update employees set and then assign the value of the string Stela to the first name column the string

12
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,390
Parkinson to the last name column.

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,020
The thirty first of December 1992 birthdate and F to gender the condition here is to have an employee

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,050
number that equals John Smith's number 9 9 9 9 0 1.

15
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,640
This means as you will optimizer will so to speak access the record with Employee Number 9 9 9 9 0 1

16
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,980
and substitute the existing values with the new ones indicated in the update statement.

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,570
Note that we did not update the higher date column value right.

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,550
Moreover Eskew well showed no error because of that.

19
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,250
This is fine as we do not have to update each value of the record of interest.

20
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:08,280
Of course we can still say we have updated the specific record okay.

21
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,890
We can finally run this query.

22
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,590
After that we will select the same employee through the employee number once again.

23
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,280
Let's see what happens.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,110
We see Stella Parkinson there not John Smith with a different birth date and gender although with the

25
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,720
same higher date.

26
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,700
Great.

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,720
Please note the following feature of the update statement.

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,090
Had we used a non-existent condition in the WHERE clause for instance an employee number of 9 9 9 9

29
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,790
0 9 my rescue well would have allowed the execution of the queery.

30
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,980
Given that they ask you well syntax is correct.

31
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,460
Nevertheless nothing would have happened.

32
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,290
The statement would have worked.

33
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,140
Affecting 0 rows because the table doesn't contain an employee with such a number at the moment of the

34
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,330
queries execution

35
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,480
awesome stay focused for another interesting feature we will discuss in the second part of this lesson.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,810
Thank you for watching.
