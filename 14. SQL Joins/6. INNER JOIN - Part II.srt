00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:07,480
Excellent Let's apply JOIN syntax to the department manager duplicate and apartments duplicate tables

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:14,320
to obtain a list of records containing information about the department number the employee number and

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,860
the department name related to every manager.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,900
I will use the letters M and D as aliases for the two tables respectively.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,220
Knowing their content we can specify the fields we would like to see right after the select keyword.

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,920
Let's extract the department in employee numbers from the department manager duplicate table and the

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,720
department name from the department's duplicate table.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,870
All right.

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,650
Therefore the next thing we must state are the two tables to be joined while doing that.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,280
Please don't forget to add their aliases so we must type department manager.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,520
Duplicate M.

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,700
careful here.

13
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,490
Enter join as this is the type of join we are implementing.

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,510
And finally deps duplicate de

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,620
awesome.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,040
To conclude the JOIN syntax we must specify the columns relating the two tables.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,790
Remember let's do that by typing on and then equalising or conceptually matching the department number

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,610
column from the first table with that column bearing the same name from the second table.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,540
These are the department number field from the department manager duplicate table and the department

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,260
number field from the department's duplicate table.

21
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,400
I would like to remind you that the relating columns of the two tables need not be named in the same

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
way.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,980
However it helps avoid confusion and is more convenient if they do.

24
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:59,320
That's why in our example both fields carry the same name before running this interesting query.

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,260
Order the results according to the department number.

26
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,940
This will improve the outputs representation.

27
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,780
Since we obtained this column from the department manager duplicate table.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,170
We will sort the information in the order by clause by the department number from the YM table.

29
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:24,860
All right let's execute this query and see what will obtain 20 rows of information.

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,030
Let's check the retrieve data.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,710
We have data about the departments from 3 to 9 only.

32
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:40,260
There is no data about departments one to 10 or 11 or about the ones labeled as null values.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,390
Why is this happening.

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,280
Inner joins.

35
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,250
Extract only records in which the values in the related columns match no values or values appearing

36
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,110
and just one of the two tables and not appearing in the other are not displayed.

37
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,520
Let's analyze the outcome by examining the tables row by row.

38
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,670
The department manager duplicate has a few no value department numbers and has no information about

39
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:18,540
Department 1 10 and 11 therefore inner joins do not present no values.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,930
The first four rows do not appear in the inner join.

41
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,940
We executed

42
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,690
OK.

43
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,190
We have 26 records in this table all together and 26 minus four gives us 22.

44
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,450
Hence there must be two records in the inner join we do not see because it displayed only 20 rows.

45
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,520
Now we can recheck the content of the department's duplicate table.

46
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,230
It has a null value department.

47
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,790
Number two do we see it in the inner join output.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
No we don't.

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,940
And why didn't SU well match the null values of the first table with this null value here.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,960
Because it would make no sense only non-North matching values are in play.

51
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,000
Moving further department number two doesn't participate in any record.

52
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,460
Do we have it in the department manager duplicate table.

53
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,560
Yes we do.

54
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,100
There are two records with it in there.

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,740
And namely these were the two records we did not see in the final output.

56
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,510
There were no values from the department's duplicate table to be matched with them in the inner join

57
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,060
awesome.

58
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,030
Finally the department's duplicate table has two more records.

59
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,650
They are of departments 10 and 11.

60
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,040
But as we mentioned they have no values to be matched with from the department manager duplicate table.

61
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,670
These two rows are dropped from the outcome.

62
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,130
Great.

63
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,770
I hope this analysis makes it clearer and explains why we say an inner join is represented by the common

64
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,220
area of the two circles in the Venn diagram.

65
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,820
This area is namely the set of the matching values of both tables which are the only ones displayed

66
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,880
in the inner join output.

67
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:27,510
And what if such matching values did not exist simply the result set will be empty.

68
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,650
There will be no link between the two tables.

69
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,970
Thanks for watching.
