1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,420
We spent significant time introducing joins in the inner join type.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,030
The benefit of doing this extensive introduction was that now you can quickly understand and learn other

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:18,610
types of Eskew Well joins the Venn diagram you see here allows you to visualize how the left join works.

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,740
Its output allows us to see all records from the table on the left side of the join including all matching

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,380
rows of the two tables.

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,770
That's why compared to the inner join the resultset colored in red include the rest of the area the

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:44,020
left table in su l terms this translates in retrieving all matching values of the two tables plus all

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,120
values from the left table that matched no values from the right table.

9
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,960
To clarify this concept.

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,630
Let's see an application first let's remove the duplicates from the two tables.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,140
This would allow us to explain the types of Joines we will introduce in the next few lessons better

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,660
duplicate values and flatter output with repeating records and do not contribute to the results we obtain

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,040
meaningfully.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,770
That is why we decided to complete the section about Joines without them practicing with duplicates

15
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,770
will be left as part of the exercises in this section.

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,730
So don't worry you will deal with them while proceeding with their course.

17
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,240
All right technically after deleting the rows in which we see the respective employee and department

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,400
numbers might ask well will delete all initial records and all their duplicates.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,410
So to proceed we must add back the initial records.

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,820
Please don't forget to do that

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,800
ha.

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,640
Ok everything looks good now.

23
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,930
So do you know what else we can do.

24
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,160
We can load the same code we used in the previous exercise.

25
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,560
The joints and tax will be subject to a slight change though.

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,820
Instead of relating the two tables to the keyword join or inner join we must type left join

27
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,270
OK that's all that needs to be modified in the code.

28
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,570
Let's see what will happen when we execute this query.

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,500
It returned 26 rows 6 rows more than the 20 rows we obtain in the example about inner joints which are

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
the 6 rows that make the difference.

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,320
Let's check this out to start our analysis.

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,970
Please refer to the Venn diagram.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,080
These six records represent the area filled with blue.

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,010
This is the part of the Left set where no values match with the right table.

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,630
Technically speaking.

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,380
Luckily all six records of interest are in the top part of the output.

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,710
First all four records that appear in the manager's table but are not seen in the department's table

38
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,140
have been retrieved.

39
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:08,040
They referred to employees with numbers 9 9 9 9 0 4 5 6 and 7.

40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:14,460
Why are these four rows retrieved because they were registered in the table on the left but not in the

41
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,900
table on the right.

42
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,240
There are no department number values that can match these records with the table on the right since

43
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,940
they are an example of non-matching values from the left table.

44
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,040
Right.

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,750
There are two more records we must discuss the ones of department two from the left table department

46
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,450
manager duplicate.

47
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,920
They appear in the left join output.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,380
If you remember there are no such records in the department's duplicate table.

49
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,950
Right

50
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:53,430
there we had information for departments 1 3 4 5 and so on until 11 and nothing about department to

51
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,990
the two records appear in the final left join list.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,130
But there were no corresponding values for the department name field that can come from the table on

53
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,250
the right perfect.

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,090
Basically this is proof that differently from what we saw for inner joins when working with left joins

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,360
the order in which you join tables matters.

56
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:23,820
Having the managers table M or the departments table D on the left can change results completely in

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,750
the next video.

58
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,280
We'll provide an example of what happens when we switch the order of the two tables.

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Thank you for watching.
