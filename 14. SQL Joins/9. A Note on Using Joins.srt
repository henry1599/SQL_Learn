00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,000
In this lesson we'll provide you with a few notes on using joints not just inner joins but any types

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,030
of joins.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,440
First we saw that in the output we can select different columns from the tables we are referencing in

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,870
the last example we chose the department and employee numbers from the managers duplicate table and

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,980
the department name from the department's duplicate table.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,570
We could have also added the starting and ending date of managers contracts.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,790
Let's check for him from date

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,270
and him to date

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,280
100 percent.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,560
So we may add any combination of columns we'd like in our output.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,710
The only condition is that each column must be part of one of the join tables.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,690
A second note I would like to share with you is that some people prefer typing the code in the from

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,050
block first so they specify in advance.

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,190
All alias's they will need in the rest of the query.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:16,300
For instance they would first type from department manager duplicate M. inner join departments duplicate

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,270
De on the equality of the two department numbers.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,220
Then they will specify the selections of interest inserting the field names with the help of the assigned

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,250
aliases.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,600
This might be helpful if you are joining more than 2 tables.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,180
But in my opinion one can get used to remembering a few letters and follow the top down flow of the

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,320
query anyway.

22
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,370
The order to be followed is that the coders discretion.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,480
What matters is if the query you've written is correct.

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,460
All right as far as the inner join syntax is concerned the word enter is not obligatory.

25
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,950
It could be omitted in this query whether you type inner join or just join.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,990
It makes no difference as Cuil will always understand you are talking about an inner join.

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,490
This is what practitioners would typically do.

28
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,470
That's why we will use join instead of inner join another issue a novice Eskew Well programmer could

29
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,290
encounter is whether the order in which you specify the matching columns matters.

30
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,200
Meaning is there any difference between typing M department number equals D department number.

31
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:45,220
And d department number equals M department number no.

32
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,580
There is no difference.

33
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,590
It is up to you.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,330
I use the table first and the detail second to avoid confusion with the order in which I designated

35
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,790
the two tables to be joined

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,550
and this might be a very useful trick as you will see in the next lectures.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,750
Otherwise from a technical perspective there is no difference OK.

38
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,720
Good let's focus on the order by clause.

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,120
Do you remember we sorted the output we obtained according to the department number from the managers

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
duplicate table.

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,300
Technically this query will work if you remove the table indication

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,740
or if you change it to the department's duplicate table.

43
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,040
The point here is that it is not obvious why we use him an apartment number and not something else.

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,490
But you will appreciate this little detail when you advance and work with much larger data sets procedures

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,900
indexes and other tools.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,540
Unless you use this notation when indicating the column and the department managers duplicate table

47
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,150
ask you well will display an error.

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,430
I hope that after going through these notes you feel you have joined the rescue community in the next

49
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,020
video.

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,950
We will show you what duplicate records are and how to deal with them.

51
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,190
Thank you for watching.
