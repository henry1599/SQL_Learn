00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,080
Is a teacher at the beginning of the course we talked about the advantage of using relational databases.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,800
Remember we worked on an example with the sales database where we explain how applying relational algebra

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,120
techniques to fields with identical type of information into tables can speed up retrieving data.

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,440
You didn't forget this right.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:29,900
Well ladies and gentlemen this is a turning point in our Eskew Well journey in the lessons to come.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:37,310
You will learn how relating Eskew will tables works in practice joins are the Cuil tools that allow

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,510
us to construct a relationship between objects.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,060
Think about strategies that would allow us to link some of the tables in our employees data.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,300
How can we know what information can be retrieved from the different tables and what should be the criteria

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,110
according to which we will create a relationship between two tables relational schemas are the perfect

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,780
tool that will help you find a strategy for linking tables.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,820
Let's examine the representation of the employees database in specific.

13
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,260
We'll focus on the employees and the department employee tables.

14
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,530
Technically a join shows a result set containing fields derived from two or more tables.

15
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,590
So we can use a join to relate the employees and the department employee table then extract information

16
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,750
like employee number first and last name from the Employees table and department number and start date

17
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,980
of the labor contract from the department employee table.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,410
The idea of using joins is twofold.

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,900
First we must find a related column from the two tables that contains the same type of data in our case.

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,790
This can be the employee number column.

21
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,050
This technique would then allow us to extract information from the two tables.

22
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,740
Under certain conditions based on the employee number column.

23
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:12,020
Second we will be free to add columns from these two tables to our output in our example.

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,470
We could obtain the fields we just mentioned employee number and name

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,020
department number and start contract date

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,070
great in the next video we'll show you how the JOIN syntax works.

27
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,790
Before that while still at this stage thinking about a strategy for retrieving data from different tables

28
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,180
please be very careful about the following.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,520
The columns you use to relate tables must represent the same object such as ID but the tables you are

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,980
considering need not be logically adjacent in the relational schema an example of two logically adjacent

31
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,620
tables.

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,580
Are the employees and apartment manager tables

33
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,260
and the employees and titles tables.

34
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,070
The department manager table and the department employee table are not logically adjacent.

35
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:23,840
This means they can be joined to and you won't have to indicate the relationship that goes through the

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,420
Employees table and the employee number key

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,180
or through departments and the department number key.

38
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,010
Specifically

39
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,710
what is important is you have found a related column connecting the two tables.

40
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,110
Awesome in the videos that follow.

41
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,820
We will show you the most notable types of joins in my rescue.

42
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,400
Well to do this.

43
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,700
We will use two duplicate tables you have graded one of them the department's duplicate in the exercise.

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,490
After this lecture you will modify it and you will create a new table that will be a duplicate of the

45
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,820
department managers table hence assumed this exercise is a refresher on the Data Definition Language

46
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,180
part of the school syntax in our next lesson.

47
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,960
We will start with inner joins.

48
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,440
Thank you for watching.
