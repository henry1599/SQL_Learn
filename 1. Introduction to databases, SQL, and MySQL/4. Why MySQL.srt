00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,440
OK, so... at this point you might be telling yourself: Great Let me install a software containing SQL and
1

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,780
start the course.
2

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,220
Unfortunately, it is not so simple. Why? To implement SQL commands,
3

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,990
you will need a database management system, often called a database or a platform.
4

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,350
The problem is there are a few popular databases out there, which are all based on SQL. They support
5

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,920
various forms of the original language and there are only slight differences between different versions.
6

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,540
As a developer, you want to learn how to use the one that is the most suitable for your situation.
7

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,440
We will base our course entirely on MySQL,
8

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,150
but you should know there are other platforms like Oracle, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server,
9

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,450
postscripts sequel.
10

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,090
Maria DB, Microsoft Access, and so on.
11

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,050
The minor differences between the versions of the SQL language mean that transferring from one database
12

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,150
to the other (which usually happens if your changing jobs) would not be an obstacle for you.
13

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,270
If you are a user of another platform, you can still take this course and easily apply the tools we teach.
14

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,070
So, why do we choose MySQL? Because it is reliable mature and open source.
15

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,760
The latter means it is free.
16

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,370
It is used by many institutions and companies, including Facebook YouTube, Dropbox, Twitter, Pinterest, Booking.com
17

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,760
and LinkedIn.
18

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,300
Considering the well-renowned DB-Engines Ranking, MySQL comes as the first open-source relational
19

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,850
database management system. Yes, 
20

21
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,840
Oracle is on top with only a slight advantage,
21

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,310
but don't forget it is a paid software!
22

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,320
Therefore, aiming at providing you with the best experience possible,
23

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,670
we chose MySQL.
24

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,200
Now let's dig into some Database and SQL theory.
25

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,210
This will provide the set of tools you'll need when we deal with various SQL tasks in the lessons
26

27
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,350
to come.
27

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,260
Thanks for watching!
