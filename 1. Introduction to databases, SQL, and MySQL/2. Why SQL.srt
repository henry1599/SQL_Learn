00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,130
So... why study SQL?
1

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,280
Put yourself in the shoes of an employee or a manager of a company who works with large amounts of data.
2

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,590
For example, you could be working in Business Intelligence (BI), data science, database administration,
3

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,870
or back-end web development.
4

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,320
Any of these jobs relate to storing large amounts of data.
5

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,560
Therefore, before carrying out any analysis with the data, you will have to retrieve it.
6

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,120
As a consequence, the focus of our course is namely on developing the skills required to solve business
7

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,670
analytical problems and applying solutions in a software that allows you to extract the desired information
8

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,340
from the database. To achieve all this, you need SQL.
9

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,350
SQL means Structured Query Language.
10

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,460
It is a programming language specifically designed for working with databases.
11

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,710
It allows you to create, manipulate, and share data, especially data from relational database management
12

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,030
systems.
13

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,400
The way to tell the computer to extract information from the database for you is by writing queries
14

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,500
in SQL. A query, pronounced 'query' or 'querry', is a piece of code
15

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,110
inducing the computer to execute a certain operation that will deliver the desired output.
16

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,200
The latter process is called querying the database.
Briefly, SQL is the language that allows you to
17

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,280
write queries that the computer can execute and then provide database insights in return.
18

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,200
The good thing about SQL is it is an intuitive and easy-to-learn language.
19

20
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,900
Be careful, as this does not mean using it will be a simple task - 
20

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,140
not at all!
21

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,380
Sometimes, the business problems you must solve will be peculiar and will involve the processing of large
22

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,980
amounts of data. Despite being relatively simple in its structure, SQL can be powerful while computing
23

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,560
very complex tasks.
24

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,890
This is why in this course we provide the raw skills you'll need to become a web programmer, a data analyst,
25

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,510
a data scientist, or a business intelligence analyst.
26

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,520
The idea is to combine video lessons and advanced exercises that will show you SQL is cool and fun
27

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,370
to work with!
28

29
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,360
And, if for some strange reason, you're still wondering whether SQL as a programming language worth
29

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,900
having in your skillset,
30

31
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,760
Let me show you the following statistics.
31

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,270
A Techworm study shows as well as the most demanded programming language for 2017
32

33
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,470
(in general not in a specific sector).
33

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,610
Indeed.com share the same information for 2016.
34

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,100
Indeed.com also ranks SQL high when related to lucrative job positions.
35

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,980
It is true.
36

37
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,760
Sometimes, these kinds of studies are indeed biased.
37

38
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,390
So, let's change the question and refer to a study conducted by Stack Overflow, where they asked over
38

39
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,860
56,000 developers in 173 countries "Which are the most used technologies?"
39

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:01,760
The top three are: 
1. JavaScript - 55.4%
2. SQL - 49.1%
3. Java - 
40

41
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,920
36.3%.
41

42
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,380
Therefore, SQL is a highly-demanded skill on the job market, no matter how you look at it.
42

43
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,630
Stay tuned for the next video to understand what it is and why it is the most suitable software environment
43

44
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,190
for this course.
44

45
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,120
Thanks for watching!
