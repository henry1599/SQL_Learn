Hello and welcome to our SQL course! I am Martin and I am a programmer who has spent significant time
1

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,290
working with SQL and databases.
2

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,020
It is my pleasure to present a course that stands out from the rest of the SQL courses available
3

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,900
on Udemy and online.
4

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,190
This course is different, because we will not repeat everything written in one of the textbooks about
5

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,770
SQL and relational databases.
6

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,110
Instead I will provide you with the set of SQL practical tools you will need at your workplace.
7

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,670
No useless concepts.
8

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Everything is straight to the point and easy to understand.
9

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,820
The curriculum we have prepared for you comprises a heterogeneous set of topics data analysts and data
10

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,260
managers need in their daily work. SQL allows these professionals to manipulate large sets of data.
11

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,610
An advantage of using SQL is its syntax is intuitive, which predisposes you to learn it quickly.
12

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,400
You'll first need to internalize the meaning of a few specific terms if you want to grasp the wide
13

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,850
scope of its application and the ease with which this language can solve sophisticated tasks.
14

15
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,430
Therefore, in the first part of this course, we will focus on explaining databases, database management
15

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,490
systems, and SQL.
16

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,740
I have organized the videos so the abstract ideas are easy to understand.
17

18
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,020
No, this will not be a set of boring theoretical SQL concepts you'll never hear at your workplace.
18

19
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,390
This is precisely the knowledge you need to understand how to work with data, tables, relational database
19

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,080
management systems, and their visual representation!
20

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,790
Before we start, I would like to ask a favor.
21

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,940
Do not skip any of the lectures in the first part!
22

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,810
I promise they will help you develop the perfect orientation and logical reasoning required for smooth,
23

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,780
high-quality coding throughout the course.
24

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,370
After the first part, we'll show you how to setup the software environment you'll need in this course,
25

26
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,390
and you'll be able to roll up your sleeves and start programming.
26

27
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,450
The best part is you won't just see how you can work with an existing database.
27

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,850
We will show you how to create an entirely new database from scratch!
28

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,550
That's great, right?
29

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
Just wait to hear what comes after that.
30

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,380
In this course, we will work with a real-world database from GitHub.
31

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,660
It is large enough and will give you a good idea of how we can use SQL in real-life situations.
32

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,930
It is not a small data set gathered for a beginners' course.
33

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,550
I am sure you will appreciate this aspect of the course.
34

35
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,110
We believe this is the right way to learn as well.
35

36
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,600
Then, after you learn how to set up a database on your own, you will plunge into the wonderful world of
36

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,500
data manipulation.
37

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,320
This is the section where you will learn how powerful SQL can be when used for the extraction of
38

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,220
information and insights from a database.
39

40
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,060
You'll go through: 
- the classical SQL statements 
- column and table constraints 
- functions.
40

41
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,200
Then, we will cover more sophisticated topics such as: 
- joins
- subqueries
41

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:02,410
- self-joins
- views. 
Finally, we'll be ready to learn how to work with some tools professionals love to
42

43
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,770
use: stored procedures and functions.
43

44
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,450
We will conclude the course by learning about a few challenging advanced SQL techniques, such as
44

45
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,560
triggers and indexes.
45

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,790
Besides the fundamentals, this course will teach you a solid set of useful topics, tips, tricks, and sharp
46

47
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,850
skills that will give you an edge in the market.
47

48
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,730
I am a firm believer in the statement: 'the most effective way to learn is by doing'.
48

49
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,770
This is valid especially for SQL, because the difficulty of the tasks you must deal with at work
49

50
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,980
require previous experience.
50

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,760
So, please do the exercises attached to the lectures!
51

52
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,600
They will be in the form of quiz questions
52

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,030
and will reinforce everything you have learned in the lessons.
53

54
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,010
Should you have any queries, please reach out and write in the Q&A section.
54

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,580
We will be happy to answer within one or two business days.
55

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,240
In addition, throughout the course and in my practice, I stick to best practices and clean coding.
56

57
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,270
Remember, a well organized, or good code, is not the one
57

58
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,050
computers can understand.
58

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,920
It is the one
59

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,920
humans can understand.
60

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,030
So... what are you waiting for?
61

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,450
Dive straight in and let's begin this journey together!
