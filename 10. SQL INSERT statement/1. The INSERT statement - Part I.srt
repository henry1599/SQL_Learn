1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,440
We started this course by presenting a brief introduction to Eskew Well theory.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,900
We continued by explaining how tables can be created and how to use the insert statement.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,660
Later we learned how to create tables.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,130
You were able to set up the entire cell's database on your own.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,750
Remember that's awesome.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,430
Now in this section we are ready to explore the insert statement in a bit more detail.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,370
Let's practice inserting a few records in the Employees table.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,760
We can extract 10 records from the Employees table to see all the information is organized there.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,470
Please allow me to make the following remark in the last lecture.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,200
We increase the limit of rows displayed in an output to infinity.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,670
So in the queries in this lecture I will place limits through the limit clause great.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,590
So execute and ha nice.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,290
We retrieved 10 rows all containing information in the following columns.

14
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,530
Employee number birth date first and last name gender and hire date.

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,900
A total of six columns.

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:26,570
OK let's see how to create a record in the Employees table after the key word phrase insert into.

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,400
We must specify the name of the table where we went to add information.

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,030
Then within parentheses we must indicate the column names where data will be inserted.

19
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,750
Please pay attention.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,360
You don't have to use the names of all six columns you can designate only those in which you would like

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,790
to insert data.

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,740
What follows is intuitive.

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,560
The values keyword succeeded by the same number of data values as the number of columns indicated in

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,960
the parentheses after the insert into statement.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Know that the data values should be typed within parentheses to.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
You are already acquainted with the syntax we just discussed.

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,760
Now let's put it into practice.

28
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:21,340
Will create a record of an individual named John Smith will type insert into employees and then within

29
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,250
parentheses specify the columns we want to add information into separating them by a comma.

30
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:43,160
These columns are employee number birth date first name last name gender and hire date then after the

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,910
keyword values and within parentheses type the data values that will be part of these columns again

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,450
separating them by a comma to see the Data Types of the values you will insert.

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,310
You must check the data types of this table's fields.

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,910
You can do this by going to the information section and looking at the data types in the columns tab.

35
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,170
The employee number is an integer.

36
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,770
Then you have to date values to var char values and an ENM.

37
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,190
Therefore as you insert the new records all values must be written in single quotes.

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,900
Besides the employee number

39
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:36,720
great let's assign the number 9 9 9 9 0 1 and a birth date of the 21st of April 1986

40
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,650
This record will refer to John Smith.

41
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,280
M.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,610
who is hired on the 1st of January 2011

43
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:05,100
to register this row in the data table will need to execute the insert query.

44
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,420
All right we see that we have one row affected.

45
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,890
Now let's select the 10 employees with the largest employee numbers to see if our record will appear

46
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,490
there.

47
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,620
Awesome.

48
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,940
Here he is John Smith is on the top.

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,030
Let me comment on this bizarre number 9 9 9 9 0 1.

50
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,680
Obviously this is not the next consecutive number in our super long list of employees is it.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
Remember that using such an employee number is a neat professional trick.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,920
When data is being created to test the database system the value inserted should be quite high.

53
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,810
This way it is obvious where the new data has been placed.

54
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,690
For this reason we saw John Smith on the top of the employee's list with the highest employee number

55
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,070
OK.

56
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,900
Great.

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,570
Let's move on now.

58
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,570
Let me share another my will feature with you.

59
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,950
Contrary to anything we've said so far it turns out that integers can be written within quotes too.

60
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:17,120
If you wish you can try inserting another record with the employee number within quotes you'll see the

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,570
data is still registered as an integer.

62
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,720
The explanation why is that my ask you will will automatically or some professionals would say transparently

63
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,140
convert the string into an integer.

64
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,730
The best practice is to avoid writing integers with in quotes.

65
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,970
Since this conversion consumes time and prevents the smooth operation of more advanced minuscule features

66
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:47,530
to conclude the idea is that yes you could write an integer with in quotes but this is not considered

67
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,240
a best practice.

68
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,700
That's why we would like to give you the following piece of advice.

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,530
Please remember to type integers as plain numbers without using quotes great.

70
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,340
Let's keep up the pace for our next video.

71
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,340
See you there.
