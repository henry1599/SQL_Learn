1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,780
Okay perfect Let's go ahead with the insert clause usually database administrators follow the order

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,010
of columns in terms of the way they appear in a given data table.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,690
However on certain occasions they prefer inserting data values in a different order.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,900
My Eskew Well allows for such types of data insertion.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,420
For instance should we create a data record about Patricia Lawrence.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:37,210
We would insert her birth date first then her employee number and then site the rest of the values in

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,550
the designated order.

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,470
Let's see if it works.

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,190
100 percent.

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,820
The last row we created contains information about Patricia Laurent's.

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,030
So please keep in mind that we must put the values in the exact order we have listed the column names

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,100
fantastic OK.

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,070
Let's take a look at an interesting feature of the insert syntax.

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,710
Technically the first pair of parentheses along with the column names between them can be omitted.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,950
Only insert into the table name and the values parts are mandatory.

16
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,810
If you omitted in the values section you will have to specify as many data values as there are columns

17
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,120
in the data table.

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,900
Furthermore you will have to add them in the same order in which they appear in the table.

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:45,650
For example if we use this structure and try to create a record in the Employees table with only four

20
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:55,430
instead of six columns my rescue will will display an error if we try to add six data values to the

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,450
new record.

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,100
All of them in the correct order.

23
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,210
The query should work fine.

24
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,340
Let's check

25
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:14,070
good the new piece of information is there in the next video we will show you a very powerful feature

26
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,300
of the insert statement that will do for now.

27
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,290
Thanks for watching.
