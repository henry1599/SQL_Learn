00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:08,820
In this lesson we'll show you an unsafe delete operation if we do not set a condition in the WHERE clause

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,270
of a delete statement.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,560
We are taking a big risk.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,180
This could potentially lead to the removal of all the tables records.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,570
That's why we must be very careful when using this statement always let's recall what we have in the

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,970
department's duplicate table the numbers and names of nine departments in the company.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,100
Let's execute a delete statement without a WHERE clause attached to it.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,700
You see nine rows were affected.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,320
Now we can check the table once more.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,740
It couldn't be emptier than that to undo the changes we should be able to execute a rollback statement.

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,280
OK.

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,550
And did it work.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,540
We'll have to select all the information from this tiny table to verify whether we have our data back.

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,260
Here it is waiting to be retrieved.

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,920
Therefore in conclusion we can say the following.

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,450
Be careful with the delete statement.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,180
Don't forget to attach a condition in the WHERE clause unless you want to lose all your information

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,790
in the next video.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,050
We will compare drop delete and truncate.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,140
See you there.
