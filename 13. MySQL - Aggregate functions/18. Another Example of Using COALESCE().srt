There is another interesting way in which we can use coalesce.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,930
We can have a single argument in a given function.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,070
How should it be interpreted.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,340
Quite simply the value indicated as an argument will be displayed technically.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,600
And this example coalesced was used to show one additional column and the output practitioners find

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,450
this trick useful of some hypothetical result must be provided in a supplementary column.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:36,270
In our situation we saw how the apartment manager name appears in all records of the fake column.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,410
This way if you are still building the table and perhaps the database coalesce can help you visualize

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,380
a prototype of the tables final version and thus consider whether to create a real column containing

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,190
the department manager's name.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,770
Finally please remember that this trick is carried out with coalesce only if you substitute it with

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,420
if no.

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:09,330
For example workbench will display an error because if Noal works with precisely two arguments while

14
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,280
coalesce can have one two or more arguments.

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,190
For this reason on most occasions professionals prefer using coalesce instead of if null with this we

16
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,310
conclude our aggregate forget functions S..

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:32,240
In our next section we will study Joines one of the most powerful and handy tools in my rescue well

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,530
and Eskew Well in general.

19
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,980
Thank you for watching.
