00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,820
Round is a numeric or math function you can use in my ask you.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:12,840
Well it is usually applied to the single values that aggregate functions return.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:19,260
Look at the average value we obtained in the previous video assume you don't want to show dollar amounts

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,780
and since then that you would like to present the number as a whole integer.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,070
This will be an easy task for the round function.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,460
Its syntax is very simple.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,820
It embraces its argument which is the number that must be rounded round can be located anywhere in the

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,130
query as long as the numeric value has been provided within the parentheses.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:49,580
In our case rounds should precede the average function together with its argument.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,780
Let's run the query to see what we get.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,530
Awesome.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,770
The same number rounded to the closest integer.

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,990
Sixty three thousand seven hundred sixty one.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,160
Fantastic.

15
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,830
In addition don't forget that you can have a second argument of the round function after average salary.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,400
You can put a comma and add a number which will equal the number of digits you see after the decimal

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,690
point of the value in your output.

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,460
Here given that the aggregate function gives us an average of a monetary value it makes sense to round

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,650
the result to a value with a precision of since.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,060
Let's say two digits after the decimal point would be a satisfactory result.

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,270
This code complies with the syntax required.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,140
Let's execute it and see if we obtain what we want

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,170
100 percent.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:57,310
Sixty three thousand seven hundred sixty one dollars and twenty cents excellent in our next lesson.

25
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,440
We will study another built in function which is considered in advanced as Cuil tool.

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,380
It is called coalesce.

27
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,710
Thank you for watching.
