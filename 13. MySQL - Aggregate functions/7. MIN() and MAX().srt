1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,100
Or you.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,000
OK.

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:08,500
So max and min return the maximum and minimum value of the column.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,990
If you're asking yourself wait which is the highest salary we offer you will need the maximum value

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:21,690
from the salary column would you placing it right after the select keyword.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,920
The max function can retrieve this value for you then conclude by from salaries in a semi-colon.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,640
Let's run the query to see the result.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,870
Well the highest salary paid by the company is one hundred fifty eight thousand two hundred twenty dollars

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,060
per annum.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,030
Not bad.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,430
And which is the lowest contract value in the company hopefully of an intern or a young newcomer to

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,330
get the answer.

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,170
Substitute the max function with men without doing anything with the rest of the code in the query execute

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,160
thirty eight thousand seven hundred and thirty five dollars.

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,650
As you can see Min returns the lowest from the list of numeric values.

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,160
Great in our next video we'll learn about the average function.

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,480
Thank you for watching.
