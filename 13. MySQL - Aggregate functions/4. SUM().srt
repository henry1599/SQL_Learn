1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,160
End.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,040
Right.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,710
So now that you know what aggregate functions are about and how to use the first of them count we are

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,020
ready to introduce the next one.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,600
Let's all the values in the salaries column to see how much money the firm spent on salaries.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,580
All we have to do is use some instead of count and designate the salary column as an argument.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,100
Let's run this query.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,320
Boom a huge number.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,440
Don't spend too much time reading the result.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,400
Trust me it's larger than 61 billion.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,460
Wow.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,060
For the sake of this exercise let's replace the field name indicated in parentheses with this star symbol.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,080
Do you think workbench will sum all numbers from the salaries table.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,300
No it would rather raise a syntax error.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,100
That's proof.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,710
The star symbol feature goes well with only the count function.

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,360
It doesn't work with other aggregate functions.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:14,190
Overall remember that count can be applied to both numeric and non-numeric data differently some.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,650
And the remaining aggregate functions average men and Max work only with numeric data.

20
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:28,830
You can't use them with non-numeric data in the next lecture will show you how to use max and man.

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,930
Thank you for watching.
